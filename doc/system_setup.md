# System setup

This is largely going to be left up to you, but this project was created using VS Code and the beta channel of Flutter on a Linux/Ubuntu system, and for the web version it helps to have WebStorm.

Tool | URL
-|-
Dart SDK | https://webdev.dartlang.org/guides/get-started#2-install-dart
Flutter | https://flutter.io/get-started/install
VS Code | https://code.visualstudio.com
WebStorm | https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download
Android Studio | https://developer.android.com/studio

> Web applications require the normal Dart SDK, and cannot use the one that comes prepackaged with Flutter.

## Environment (Linux/Ubuntu)

In `~/.profile` add the following paths to access the command-line tools. This assumes the Flutter repo is at `~/flutter` and Android tools, etc. (optional) are at at `~/android`.

```sh
# Add Dart SDK binaries to the path, if they exist.
if [ -d "/usr/lib/dart/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="/usr/lib/dart/bin:$PATH"
fi

# Add Flutter binaries to the path, if they exist.
if [ -d "$HOME/flutter/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/flutter/bin:$PATH"
fi

# Add binaries from Dart pub packages to the path, if they exist.
if [ -d "$HOME/.pub-cache/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/.pub-cache/bin:$PATH"
fi

# Add Android tools to the path, if they exist.
if [ -d "$HOME/android/sdk/tools/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/android/sdk/tools/bin:$PATH"
fi

export PATH
```

## Completing system setup

For the web version you should make two additional binaries available through pub, `webdev` and `stagehand`.

```sh
> pub global activate webdev
> pub global activate stagehand
```

Finally, here is the output of `flutter doctor -v` for reference.

```
> flutter doctor -v

## Directory structure

Each package requires a `pubspec.yaml` and should have a `README.md`. For package layout conventions see https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/package-layout.

The structure used in this project is something like

```
base/
  pubspec.yaml
  README.md
  CHANGELOG.md
  test/
  lib/              (other packages import these files)
    config.dart     (build configurations)
    themes.dart
    resources.dart  (abstract local and remote resource definitions)
    pages.dart
    layouts.dart
    forms.dart
